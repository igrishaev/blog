I totally get your point. When you (or another programmer) are the one who implements all the business requirements. Both ways the requirements are checked into version control, run, tested, etc. as you say. The not-DDD approach is easier for you to write, debug, reason about, share with other programmers, etc. exactly as you have written.

Now imagine you implement the base prototype and then let the business people play with it, write more rules themselves whenever they need to. And they want to keep the rules in some normal (for them) storage, out of the development lifecycle (not git, but some CMS, DB, whatever). Do you still believe the "just use clojure functions" will do?
