Hi Ivan, 

I'm curious: would you still recommend Lisp (or Scheme) for a beginning programmer nowadays? Basically Scheme + working through SICP? 

In my case, I am currently in the Ecole 42 programme, which is basically C and C++ (later in the core curriculum), which is heavily imperative and OOP, so I was wondering what might help supplement my learning through a functional lens.
