Thanks for sharing, it is another great writing!

Some remarks from me:

> Both our software and hardware are developed such that it’s easier to scroll the text down rather than to the right.


```clojure
(ns some.ns
  (:require [clojure.string :as str]
            [clojure.java.io :as io]))
```            

The total width < 80 characters, so it is 
not a valid point to me.
But I always wanted to know why some people prefer another way of formatting.

```clojure
(when-not user
  (e/error! "User not found" {:id user-id}))
```

It violates

> Don’t use one-letter aliases even for the built-in modules like clojure.string or clojure.walk

typo:

`did’t` -> `didn't`

`(add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace)`

In Markdown trailing spaces are significant.
