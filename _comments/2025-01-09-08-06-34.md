From the Slack discussions it doesn't seem like "a russian thing" was derogatory but just that it was a tool that was popular among russian devs but not elsewhere, I couldn't find any comment that was refusing Telegram on the basis that it was russian. Seems like search and threads were the two main missing features (without even considering the need for moderation or not)
