Roman,

I think that Excision is not an option as it's really slow. The better choice would be run your tests against in-memory version of Datomic, so at the end, the entire DB just gets wiped.

Yes your fixtures will spend some time to apply the schema and fill the database with test data, but on the other hand, it will guarantee isolation of tests.

If you use not in-memory db but any physical backend like Postgres or Mysql, you can just delete the database. Or, for each test, you can generate a random database and then clean them once a day.
