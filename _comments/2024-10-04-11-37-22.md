Hello,

Would you be interested in dropping up to 2 pounds a week without hitting the gym?

Most people don’t believe this is possible, but it is, because it has been working for me and I never gain the weight back.

I work for Elebands and we make ultra-thin, fashionable body weight bands that come in 5 - 30 pound sets and they look so sexy and sleek you won’t believe they are weights. 
 
You just put them on your wrist, ankle and waist for the entire day and you’ll burn up to 1,500 calories a day, with no workout needed.
 
Basically, the added weight makes your body work harder and burn more calories as you go about your day.
