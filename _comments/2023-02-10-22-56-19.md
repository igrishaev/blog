Do you use lists with map? filter? reduce?
You use Monads
Do you use optionals? streams? pipes? transducers?
You use Monads
Do you use promises? futures? deferred?
You use Monads 

The monadic pattern is everywhere, because it is useful.

With all due respect I don't think you entirely know what you are talking about. Clojure uses monads everywhere!! You are confusing the concept with some implementation you dislike.

It's amazing how this naive and ill informed articled keeps popping up every time someone dislikes a Monad library or similar, and then cites it as a "valid source"

You need to get your concepts straight.
