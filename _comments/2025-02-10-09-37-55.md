There are no conflicts now, but the EDN spec reserves un-prefixed tags for future built-ins:

>Tag symbols without a prefix are reserved by edn for built-ins defined using the tag system.

>User tags must contain a prefix component, which must be owned by the user (e.g. trademark or domain) or known unique in the communication context.

from [rules for tags](https://github.com/edn-format/edn?tab=readme-ov-file#rules-for-tags)

It's the kind of thing that doesn't matter until it matters a lot, so would prohibit a lot of people from using this in production.
