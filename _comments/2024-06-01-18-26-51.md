Ok, thanks a lot
But I'm not sure what do you mean by "truncate" in datomic?
I see three options right now:
1. Use of Excision to remove everything with :each
2. Delete db, create db, apply schema with :each (~60ms on my mac m1)
3. Use :once but keep track of data collision in the current ns

Can you recommend anything?
