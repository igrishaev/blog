Hi Roman! Yes, starting and stopping the system in each test is slow. Thus, we usually bootstrap the system using the :once keyword. But you still need to cleanup the database from temporary data so each test doesn't affect the others. Just add the second :each fixture that truncates all the known tables, and that will be enough.
