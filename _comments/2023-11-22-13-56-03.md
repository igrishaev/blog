As [Dang said](https://grishaev.me/en/ddd-lie#comment-1700490558492) - 

> not designing the software in the first place, but rather just react to a business’ needs, while adding features all the time - this is prone to end up in spaghetti code, doesn’t matter which language

I would have to see the talks you're rebuking. I agree that you should not place complex logic in a data structure. Your example is indeed quite difficult to read.

Expressing state as data has its place. I think you'd agree. I've found it valuable in specifications and API routes, for instances. It's much easier to manipulate with functions down the line. But every practice has its limits. Perhaps what's missing here are some good guidelines about *when* one might reach for this specific tool of Data Driven Design.
