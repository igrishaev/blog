Hi Ivan. Thank you for the article.
I'm worried about creating/deleting db with use-fixture and :each flag.
It seems to be inefficient with lots of tests.

What do you think might be a better configuration when I use integrant to start a system and use-fixture with :once flag? I want to avoid start/stop a system for :each test
