Well, you did mention that EDN can be read from a separate file ...
Or a hundred files, or a thousand file ...
For every Input you can expect different behavior.

When you edit/commit/push/build a program there is still a single program,
hopefully with deterministic behavior. You do not advocate building
hundreds different program, right?

However any comparison and implications of reading data and (load ...)
for code is missing from this piece.
