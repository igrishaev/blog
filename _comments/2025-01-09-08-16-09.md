Yeah one should not use LLMs like a monkey and expect them to build nuclear reactors for us. On the other hand given sufficient context around problems I've been able to parallelize a lot of problem solving. It is still not perfect and I am not sure whether or not it saves time already overall after including the proofreading, but since the models keep improving it will definitely be a must know tool in the future.
