What I learned is that you can prove anything in a blog post with sufficiently vague examples like “some-field” and “other-field”.

Also, that when some people say “data” they really mean “ad-hoc undocumented DSL”, which is basically the polar opposite of data.  And then they’ll use that to try to convince you that data is the problem.

“Your own experience is much more valuable” — agreed!  I don’t know who these YouTube presenters are that you think are promoting their own failed architectures (why would anyone do that?), but I have yet to be let down by data, and have never accidentally written a compiler of vector-based expressions.
