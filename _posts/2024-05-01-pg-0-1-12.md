[PG2 version 0.1.12][pg2] is out. Aside from internal refactoring, there are
several features I'd like to highlight.

**First**, the library is still getting faster. The latest benchmarks prove
15-30% performance gain when consuming `SELECT` results. Actual numbers depend
on the nature of a query. Simple queries with 1-2 columns work faster than
before:

{% include static.html path="pg-0.1.12/01.svg" class="svg-chart" %}

Metrics:

| Platform                    | JDBC.Next  | PG2 0.1.1 | PG2 0.1.2 | PG2 0.1.12 |
|-----------------------------|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| core i5 2 GHz Quad-Core 16G | 127.677926 | 43.026307 | 44.36297  | 21.941113  |
| core i9 2,4 GHz 8-Core 32G  | 83.932103  | 39.551719 | 27.672117 | 20.957904  |
| arm m1 10 cores 32G         | 49.340986  | 18.517718 | 14.670815 | 9.468902   |

Although queries with many columns are less sensitive to the new parsing
algorithm, they're still fast. Here is a chart for a complex query:

{% include static.html path="pg-0.1.12/02.svg" class="svg-chart" %}

Metrics:

| Platform                    | JDBC.Next  | PG2 0.1.1  | PG2 0.1.2 | PG2 0.1.12 |
|-----------------------------|------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| core i5 2 GHz Quad-Core 16G | 579.59995  | 273.866142 | 80.352246 | 55.835803  |
| core i9 2,4 GHz 8-Core 32G  | 447.326861 | 270.262248 | 54.34384  | 42.815123  |
| arm m1 10 cores 32G         | 206.371502 | 117.241426 | 30.444798 | 29.92079   |

PG2 has become a bit faster with HTTP. The chart below measures a number of RPS
of a Jetty server that fetches random data from a database and responds with
JSON:

{% include static.html path="pg-0.1.12/03.svg" class="svg-chart" %}

The tests were made using `ab` as follows:

~~~bash
ab -n 1000 -c 16 -l http://127.0.0.1:18080/
~~~

Timings:

| Platform                    | JDBC.Next | PG2 0.1.1 | PG2 0.1.2 | PG2 0.1.12 |
|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| core i5 2 GHz Quad-Core 16G | 555.55    | 968.51    | 915.93    | 890.62     |
| core i9 2,4 GHz 8-Core 32G  | 1304      | 1909.19   | 1688.72   | 1794.75    |
| arm m1 10 cores 32G         | 1902.31   | 2999.06   | 3026      | 3363.36    |

**The second feature** is the `:read-only?` connection flag. When it's set to
true, the connection is run in `READ ONLY` mode, and every transaction opens
being READ ONLY as well. This is useful for reading from replicas. A small
example where an attempt to delete something leads to a negative response:

~~~clojure
(pg/with-connection [conn {... :read-only? true}]
  (pg/query conn "delete from students"))

;; PGErrorResponse: cannot execute DROP TABLE in a read-only transaction
~~~

When set globally for connection, the flag overrides the same flag passed into
the `with-tx` macro. Below, the transaction is READ ONLY anyway because the
config flag is prioritized.

~~~clojure
(pg/with-connection [conn {... :read-only? true}]
  (pg/with-tx [conn {:read-only? false}] ;; override won't do
    (pg/query conn "create table foo(id serial)")))

;; PGErrorResponse: cannot execute CREATE TABLE in a read-only transaction
~~~

**Finally**, there is a new reducer called "column" which fetches a single
column as a vector. We often select IDs only, but the result is a vector of maps
with a single `:id` field:

~~~clojure
[{:id 100} {:id 101}, ...]
~~~

To get the ids, either you pass the result into `(map :id ...)` or, which is
better, specify the `:column` key as follows:

~~~clojure
(pg/with-connection [conn {...}]
  (pg/query conn
            "select id from users"
            {:column :id}))

;; [100, 101, 102, ...]
~~~

Internally, the reducer fetches the field from each row on the fly as they come
from the network. It's more effective than passing the result into `map` as it
takes only one passage.
