I'm an IT-engineer working remotely with the US and European customers. A fan of
functional programming and Lisp-family languages. Enjoy swimming and winter
sports. A father of three. Interested in books, negotiation and education. A
speaker in our local community. I wrote two books about Clojure (see the yellow
links above). Quite good with Postgres and LaTeX.

At the moment, I'm a backend engineer at [Raiffeisen Bank
International][current] (Austria). There, I do a lot of Clojure and SQL every
day. If you are interested, check out my [CV on GitHub][cv] or download a [PDF
