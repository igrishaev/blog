  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    
<p>Recently, Nikita Prokopov, a friend of mine, <a href="http://tonsky.me/blog/cursor-keys/">published a great post</a>
about remapping arrow keys. I highly support that idea; we really move cursor
often. It is too time-consuming to shift a palm to and fro across the
keyboard. But this material inspired me to share my own ideas about keyboards
and typing. Please read Nikita’s post first before we go further.</p>

<p>The main statement I’d like to highlight is <strong>all the modern keyboard are
useless in general</strong>. Literally, I mean: a typical typing device might be used
only in ineffective way. Once you start explore it trying to be productive, your
very body will alarm you with pain saying “please don’t do that”. And this is
not a joke.</p>

<p>There is such a metaphor as “share you pain”. That’s exactly what I’d like to
do: to discuss the real pain caused by keyboards. The thing is, I’ve been trying
to be productive with Emacs, an ergonomic keyboard and blind typing at the same
time. (That was too much for a single pair of hands, now I see that clearly; but
not those days.)  What I’ve got was unbearable ache in my left palm. It started
a year ago and I still have it. Surely, that could be my personal trait. I do
not blame anybody. But I know for sure, our modern keyboard might be a bit
better then now.</p>

<p>Ok, take a minute and look down at your keyboard. It does not really matter if
it’s a computer one or your laptop. It is likely you’ll see a device like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/static/aws/1059232/35324750-bc25e3ac-0102-11e8-826a-af214608d263.JPG" /></p>

<p>What is wrong with it you may ask? Well, lot of things.</p>

<p>First, the keyboard does not fit your body, your natural forms. Put your hands
down on the table. Look at the angle of each hand. Do you see symmetry? Both of
your hands are tilted on the same angle relative to the invisible axis in the
middle. Now try to find such symmetry on your keyboard. You won’t. All the
buttons are tilted on an angle what is good for your right hand. But you’ve got
yet another hand, the left one! The buttons’ angle does not satisfy that left
hand at all.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/static/aws/1059232/35324895-390cda6a-0103-11e8-96bd-cfe3d455bd06.jpg" /></p>

<p>The fact of ignoring human anatomy looks quite strange to me, really. Because
nowadays, every piece of design that is used by people is being adopted for
them. About 20 years before, it could be a feature maybe. Look, ergonomic
camera! Ergonomic fridge! Today, everything we produce for human beings must be
ergonomic. It has become a default option, not a feature.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/static/aws/1059232/35325024-97ace358-0103-11e8-88de-5e48cab1d5f3.jpg" /></p>

<p>In a car, a steering wheel is put on the left if it is a European car, but not
on the right. Digital cameras have a special thick fragment put on a handle to
let a palm cover it with the whole surface and thus prevent if from falling
down. Long ago, a computer mouse was just a brick with sharpen edges. Today, it
has got curly and quite complicated form that respects anatomy. And so forth and
forth.</p>

<p>We, programmers, designers, managers, spend lots of time in front of a
computer. It’s our working tool. With its help, we get money to live and care
our families. I’d rather say that having a good computer is more important than
having a car. So why the input device is still so poor? We deserve something
better I believe.</p>

<p>The second flaw is a standard keyboard forces us to press utility buttons with
your little finger on the most of devices. That’s sick: it’s the most weakest
finger of your palm. Press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+C</code> several times. Do you feel how high tension
between the finger is? The more fingers are closer to each other, the more it is
healthier for a palm. Thanks Apple, on Mac, we mostly operate using thumb and
forefingers. But still, Alt, Shift, Control or Fn make my hand hurt again.</p>

<p>Since I’m a developer, I cannot complain on programming languages that force you
to use all the types of parentheses, colons and semicolons, single and double
colons and even apostrophes and backquotes, slashes and backslashes. The funny
fact is, all of them require your right little finger to work hard. I used to
improve my blinding typing skills some time ago; the program prompted particular
fragments of classical prose to train me. I moved fast. Once I started to write
code with blind ten-fingers method, almost all the typos were related to those
symbols I mentioned above. Say you’d like to complete a function call in
Javascript: return 42, semicolon, closing paren; curly closing paren. Damn, it
was the square one. Delete. Now it’s minus. Damn!</p>

<p>Python has been some sort of a victory: it showed that a programmic language may
be free from machinery symbols still being elegant and expressive. Any Lisp
dialect is also good: say, Clojure requires quite fewer of them. Yes, there are
three sets of parens when declaring data structures, but on the other hand,
semicolon is not used at all. Racket considers any type of parentheses as round
ones. So putting square parentheses inside round ones is just a matter of
personal choice.</p>

<p>The next thing, there are to many utility buttons I believe. Let’s count them:
Control, Shift, Alt, Caps, Function key, Command on Mac. On Windows keyboards,
there is an Application key with the Windows<sup>TM</sup> Logo<sup>TM</sup>. We
do not really need them all at once! Seriously, when I used to develop on
Windows the main modifier was control: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl-C</code>, to copy and paste, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+O</code> to
open a file, etc. On Mac, the main button is the Command key, right? But still,
the Control has not gone yet, we have in on Mac keyboards. In terminal, every
process listens for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+C</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+D</code> to be terminated. As the result, I need
two buttons instead of one.</p>

<p>And that’s more. I may say I know for sure why do we need Shift, for
example. But I’m not sure about Alt. Really, why do we need that for? The same
about the Function key. The button with the Windows<sup>TM</sup>
Logo<sup>TM</sup> looks hilarious to me: a dedicated key to open the “Start”
menu, oh dear.</p>

<p>Capslock is totally useless and takes too much room for itself. I don’t see any
reason for its existence. Every single text editor may convert selected fragment
from lower to UPPER case and vice versa.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that most the shortcuts could be made with just two utility
keys: Command and Alt/Option/Whatever. That would be enough. The only reason we
won’t ever rich that is developers would never come to agreement or any sort of
standard.</p>

<p>What makes me totally insane is those keys are named differently on various
platforms. On Mac, Alt is not Alt, but Option. In Emacs (which is really almost
an operation system) Alt is Meta, and the Command key is Control by default. I
know, there is a long story behind each of those namings, but I don’t have any
intention to dive into it.</p>

<p>Another thing I cannot tolerate is when a key is marked with a pictogram instead
if its name. Their forms are so complicated and really say nothing! At lest
Shift has some sort of sense behind its pictogram: a thick arrow that says
“press me and I’ll move the layout up”. Now take Mac’s Command key: ⌘. I
don’t have a clue what does that figure mean. It isn’t better then the
Windows<sup>TM</sup> Logo<sup>TM</sup>. Alt is the worst case: ⌥. I even
cannot find proper words to describe those lines where one of them breaks for no
reason. For me, it always takes about five to ten seconds to parse an expression
like “press ⌥⇧T to open a new tab”. Even Perl code looks better to
me.</p>

<p>Moving on, there cannot be an excuse for such huge space button. Yes, it appears
quite frequently in European languages, no matter if a text is a prose, a poem
or Linux source code. But the greater frequency is still not an option for
increasing size of a button! For example, the “e” letter appears quite often in
English; bit its size as little as “j” or “x” that have the lowest rate.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/English_letter_frequency_%28alphabetic%29.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>If your keyboard is not just from the shop, look at your spacebar carefully. Or
even detach it and move it closer to the light. You’ll see that there is some
fixed area where your thumb finger hits the surface constantly; but the rest of
it is untouched and probably covered with dust (or food, to be honest).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/static/aws/1059232/35332529-477a28dc-011c-11e8-966b-2e285bf4248c.JPG" /></p>

<p>Here is mine spacebar: it’s plain to see that both left and right sides are
polished with my fingers. The left side is even more because of Emacs. But the
center of the button is dirty. (I used to shift levels in Photoshop to let you
see it better.) I cannot even remember when I pressed it in the center. It is
just a waste of useful space.</p>

<p>It’s clear to me that huge spacebar was just borrowed from ancient
typewriters. They had it probably because of two reasons. The first one is there
was just unused space on the lowest row; it should be filled with something. The
second is, pressing mechanical keys required significant physical effort in
those days. So the thumb finger moves could be a bit inaccurate. But all of this
do not relate to our days anymore.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/static/aws/1059232/35332606-99d38f56-011c-11e8-8c7c-dae03d931dd7.jpeg" /></p>

<p>You may look at Asian keyboards that have tiny spacebars. The reason is, in
hieroglyphs, spaces appear quite rarely. Pay attention, a spacebar still might
be pressed without any troubles whereas now a user has got some additional keys.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/static/aws/1059232/35332679-dd1afcd6-011c-11e8-89ae-2c9c0df8303e.jpg" /></p>

<p>The image was taken from that great post: <a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/tiny_space_bar_japanese_keyboard.html">“Tiny Space Bar on Japanese
Keyboards”</a>. There are far more interesting layouts there.</p>

<p>That was the main reason I had to abandon my MS Sculpt keyboard. Its spacebar
key is really huge as I’m not a human but an elephant. In Emacs, almost every
single operation requires holding Command key. As the result, my thumb finger
have been in such a position for minutes or even hours:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/static/aws/1059232/35332888-cb97a792-011d-11e8-87ed-5cee9f8deab4.jpg" /></p>

<p>Every single coding session ended up with pain in my palm. My intention was to
remap the left space button to the Command key. That would be a great success if
it was possible; but it’s not. The keyboard sends the same machine-wise signals
for both spacebars. So every remapping tool considers them as the same physical
button.</p>

<p>At the moment, I’m dreaming of some sort of keyboard with a tiny space. It would
be great to press both space and Command keys without moving my thumb finger far
from each other.</p>

<p>It is 2018 behind my window, but none of operation systems has good remapping
tool out from the box. Starting with a fresh system, I need to download and
install some software and set it up somehow. On Mac, we’ve got
<a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">Karabiner</a> which is the most developed tool so far. But as far as I
see, hacking a keyboard input is a tricky stuff that can be prevented by the
manufacturer at any moment. Apple does have any intentions to care about
Karabiner + Mac compatibility.</p>

<p>Karabiner was rewritten from scratch several times due to major Mac OS
releases. Although they have done a great job so far, some occasional bugs still
appear from time to time. For me, the keyboard input just hangs sometimes. The
keyboard seems to be turned off completely for ten seconds. Then it tries to
play all that key sequence that has been delayed at once causing unpredictable
behavior: windows close and open, dialogs pop up and so on.</p>

<p>The standard key remapping dialog in Mac is ridiculously poor and may satisfy
only beginners.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/static/aws/1059232/35332956-13c617d8-011e-11e8-8dbb-41cc89c7c54d.png" /></p>

<p>Most of the “ergonomic” keyboard are terrifying. They are huge, quite expensive,
and full of features I will never use. One of them has a LED layer what shines
with different colors as a wave. Great. Another one looks and weighs like an
anvil. All of them cost like an aircraft. You cannot buy it at your neibour
shop. After all, there is no any guarantee that you won’t put it on your shelve
to collect dust for ages.</p>

<p>More and more keyboard startups appear and try to solve those problems. They
make a website, a single YouTube video and launch Kickstarter program. I do not
have any knowledge if some of them have come to success. I mean, if Apple or any
other manufacturer started to produce their keyboards. I tend to think that most
of them are just charlatans, to be honest.</p>

<p>Computer manufactures do not care about the keyboards they produce at all. At
least they could split the buttons on two groups and change the left’s one angle
properly. Or maybe remove Caps or Control on Mac. They’ve already wiped Escape
that was quite small and didn’t cause any troubles. Oh by the way, now we’ve got
that keyboard screen on Macbooks. It is a feature that completely relies on
marketing but not user experience at all.</p>

<p>The last thing that worth be mentioned is even a great external keyboard
consumes free space and forces you to re-invent your workplace. Mac’s touchpad
is amazing, but a custom keyboard lets you either to shut your Macbook down and
use external monitor or put it on top of the built-in one. In both cases, you
lose touchpad access. Go by an external one for $100. Now you completely depend
on additional devices and the workspace has become few.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/static/aws/1059232/35333098-798c1b08-011e-11e8-8140-aae6009f123a.JPG" /></p>

<hr />

<p>I don’t know if I expressed my experience in a clear way, but altogether those
points make me upset. I hope at least something will change in the
future. Maybe, they will start to improve default keyboards to let us work
without suffering one day.</p>
