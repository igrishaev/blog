    <p>Generally, I’m a big fan of writing test. They are great: once you add them, you
cannot break logic silently anymore. The time you’ve spent on writing tests pays
off completely in that manner you won’t need to fix production on Friday’s
night. Tests cannot guarantee your code is free from errors completely,
though. But having properly designed tests greatly reduces the number of
potential mistakes.</p>

<p>For a long time, I’ve been developing only server-side tests whereas the UI
behavior was tested manually. That has been worked until the moment when we
understood we break the UI too often. That’s how the question about having UI
tests has appeared.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I didn’t anticipate maintaining client-side tests (also known as
integration test) would be so costly. Yet I managed to get stable UI tests, it
took long time of debugging, reading the source code of webdrivers and
Google/StackOverflow surfing. Here are some random thoughts on the subject.</p>

<h3 id="ui-tests-are-complex">UI tests are complex</h3>

<p>The first issue you might face when dealing with UI tests (and it has never been
written clearly in any documentation or manual) is they are unstable and flaking
by their nature. In technical terms, they are fragile and difficult to
maintain. Testing UI involves lots of technologies and protocols. Under the
hood, there is an entire stack of nested calls.  Let’s consider a typical
PHP/JS-driven web-application with Selenium-based tests. Now follow the testing
pipeline.</p>

<p>Before you run a test, you should launch the application server (probably your
REST backend) and Selenium server. Then, once you’ve started a test, it sends
request to Selenium to start a new browser session. Java spawns a new process of
webdriver – a special program that helps to automate browsers. The driver tries
to discover a browser installed on your machine. If everything is alright, the
browser process starts. Just a note: you have not done anything important yet,
but there are four processes are running already (the app, Selenium, webdriver,
browser).</p>

<p>Now then, every time you call for something like</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">driver</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">find_element_by_id</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"my_button"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>, it turns into a stack with the steps look like approximately the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>your PHP/Python/whatever code calls Selenium server.</li>
  <li>Selenium remaps the incoming data and calls webdriver server.</li>
  <li>The webdriver reads JSON body and sends corresponding binary commands to the
browser via socket channel.</li>
  <li>The browser performs those actions with some delay. There is no guarantee
about timings, the numbers depend on your OS, number of cores, amount of open
tabs and so on.</li>
  <li>If everything is alright, the data flows in the opposite way: from the
browser to the webdriver, to Selenium and finally to the app.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember, it was only a simplest API call. More complicated API expand into
series of calls and success only when all of sub-calls managed to finish
successfully.</p>

<h3 id="versioning-hell">Versioning hell</h3>

<p>What exactly may occur during the process? Well, everything.</p>

<p>The most obvious thing is the more software you are trying to work together the
more unstable the system becomes. That might not be a problem when all the
components are under your control. Say, if it was a micro-service architecture
with each node developed by your people. But if fact, they all come from
different companies with different points on the subject. Your testing library
is written by some enthusiasts. Selenium is the second group. The browser is the
third one and they do not listen to anybody, that’s for sure. Developers who
have brought the webdriver are the fourth group.</p>

<p>Now imagine that every product has its own version, release schedule and
roadmap. And the version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4.2.1</code> of this requires at least version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.2.1</code> of
that. In the release <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5.4</code> the feature X doesn’t work, you should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5.5-beta</code>
instead. And more many of that. These bits of information are never shared in
the documentation, but only in comments on Github.</p>

<p>It reminds me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appulse">The Planet Parade</a> sometimes when the system performs
only if some special version’s numbers are set together. Otherwise, it falls
apart.</p>

<h3 id="they-run-for-too-long">They run for too long</h3>

<p>Another issue with integration tests that you might not be aware about is their
long execution time. It becomes new to me after long period of maintaining
server tests that used to pass in a minute or two. Even having a small set of
integration tests, it would take much more time. If we care about running each
tests independently without affecting them each other, you need to turn the app
to its initial state. That involves resetting the database, logging out, wiping
session, preparing local files and so forth. It takes sensible amount time all
together. Be prepared your CI pipeline becomes more time-consuming.</p>

<h3 id="referencing-a-missing-element">Referencing a missing element</h3>

<p>What I’d like to highlight more in that topic is a strange error named “element
stale”. It will definitely rich you when dealing with single page application
(aka SPA). It is so common that the official Selenium site has
a <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/exceptions/stale_element_reference.jsp">dedicated page</a> and an exception
class <a href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_StaleElementReferenceException.htm">named after if</a>. The sad thing, those text is quite stingy on
describing what could be the reason of getting such an error. And more
important, how to prevent it appears. Hopefully, after long debugging sessions,
I’ve got answers to both of those questions.</p>

<p>Inside browser, every DOM element has its own unique machinery-wise
identifier. There is no a single standard of representing it. Depending on
browser, you might get either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.950889431100737-1</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c1ee22f1-b96e-5245-bd85-9e56e1781cbd</code> for the same button. But it does not
matter. What really does is it’s quite easy to refer an element that has been
removed from the DOM tree when the app page has been re-rendered.</p>

<p>That’s the root of the problem: such modern frameworks as React, Vue or whatever
else continuously update the page components inserting new HTML nodes. Even when
you have a component with a button with unique “id” attribute and it has been
re-rendered, an new DOM element instance will be created. From the browser’s
prospective, it will the another node, completely different to the previous one.</p>

<p>Each modern testing framework has high-level functions to operate on page
elements without knowing their IDs. Consider Python examples:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">driver</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">click_on_element</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"my_button"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In fact, this API call expands into at leas two low-level Webdriver API calls,
namely:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Try to discover an element ID by the search term.</li>
  <li>Try to click on that element.</li>
</ol>

<p>Looks well, but here is what takes place under the hood. You’ve got a long ID of
a link or a button, that’s great. But in a millisecond before you clicked on it,
the UI has been re-rendered. The reason of that is not so important: maybe, some
event has been triggered, or a user hovered some element when moving mouse to
it. Or maybe, the framework’s internal algorithm just decided somehow the
content should be updated. That means, the original button element you’ve got
the ID for was detached from the DOM thee and moved into a temporary array or
any other kind of data structure to wait before it is wiped completely from
memory. Instead of it, a new DOM node that looks exactly the same took those
place. But willing to click on the button, use send the outdated ID. There is no
sense in clicking on such kind of elements that are almost dead. The browser
returns corresponding error message that expands into Selenium exception.</p>

<p>I wish that paragraph was on those page. It would save me a week maybe or even
more.</p>

<p>A good solution would be to implement some kind of transactions in your
code. Let every complex API be implemented with try/catch clause with some
sensible strategy to re-call it in a case of failure, say a number of times or
by timeouts.</p>

<h3 id="high-hopes">High Hopes</h3>

<p>OK, let’s have some final thoughts on the subject, some kind of summary. Testing
UI is really far from the server-side ideal world. They are unstable, difficult
to develop and maintain. There a lots of undocumented traps you may suffer from
during the journey. But still, there are definitely some good things happening
nowadays.</p>

<p>First, the official <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/">Webdriver protocol</a> is developing actively. This
protocol is subject to substitute the outdated
Selenium <a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol">JSONWire protocol</a>. It has become a part of W3C so I hope it
will be developed so forth.</p>

<p>More Selenium-free libraries appear on
Github:
<a href="http://nightwatchjs.org/">Nightwatch</a>, <a href="https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara">Capybara</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a>… That
is great because having the only one monopolist in such specific area stops the
progress.</p>

<p>But there are lots of things to be done. What I’d like to see at first place is
some kind of cookbook with common advise and good practices on how to test UI
without suffering. Those bits should not depend on specific language or library
although there could be platform-specific sections. I have never met such kind
of a cookbook across the Internet; please correct me if there are any of them.</p>

<p>When writing a library for browser automation, it would be great to not only
cover the low-level calls but also design an abstract layer of high-level API to
make it easy to use by those who are not familiar with all the issues I
mentioned above. Say, a high-level function (or method if we talk on OOP terms)
that clicks on a button should take into account the case when the element is
stale. From my prospectives, such a functional language powered with immutable
data structures and homoiconicity as Clojure (or any Lisp-family one) would be a
great choice.</p>

<p>Ok, let’s finish for now. Thank you for listening out. Next time, I’ll say more
on technical side of testing code.</p>

      <div><p>Иван, доброго времени суток! Возможно у вас найдется пару минут мне ответить очень нуждаюсь в вашем совете. Моя основная работа не связанна с программированием, но мне эта тема интересна есть желание написать что-то типа личного кабинета, на Django и интегрировать его с 1с УТ. Читал статью на хабре и вообще давно слежу за вашим блогом - знаю что занимались 1с. Я не знаю 1с да и на Python не весь какой программист, подскажите как можно подружить это все дело какой технологией воспользоваться. Просто не зная например C# я нагуглил что мне нужно скопипастил и этот как то работает, с 1с так не получается, что качается моральной стороны заказчик идет на мой говнокод осознанно, нет необходимости в какой-то мега производительной системе. Я не поимею с него каких то миллионов цена вопроса 2 тыс и то чтоб это просто меня мотивировало могу их отдать.</p>
